7. Let the dough rise in a covered container for two hours at ~75F, then transfer to the fridge to continue bulk fermenting overnight. 
8. Once the dough has risen, gently deflate it and knead in the pearl sugar. 
9. Break into 75 - 80g balls and cook in the waffle maker.

# Notes

- This is a small amount of dough, so mixing by hand is enough for everything but the final kneading.
- A stand mixer isn't required, but is nice to have

# Variations
+50g chopped apples added after the dough has been kneaded and +15g flour to offset the liquid
